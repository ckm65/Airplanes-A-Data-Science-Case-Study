# Airplanes-A-Data-Science-Case-Study

The goal of this data challenge case study was to write a data driven article by collecting observations, modeling, and making arguments on various datasets. 

This case study is on Airline Arrival and Departures data, focusing on three key objectives :

1)Does one type of aircraft typically arrive and depart late to specific destinations? If so, which aircraft model? What is the significance? 
2)Does a specific location constantly have delayed departures and receive delayed arrival flights? If so, what location and why do you think that is? What is the significance?
3)Does a specific day of the week typically have more delayed departing and arriving flights? What is the significance?

I used python techniques to clean, merge and analyze three different datasets in order to represent the signifance in my findings. I utilized descriptive statstics, clustering methods, randomization, regression, hypothesis testing and data visualizations to support my findings. For more information on analysis please view the full case study.
